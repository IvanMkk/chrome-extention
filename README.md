## Inspiration
We all love being efficient and saving time. But typing can be slow and error-prone, especially when you're in a hurry or trying to express complex ideas. So, we thought, why not build an app that helps you type faster and smarter? That's how we came up with Tamed Mr. Typony.

## What it does
Tamed Mr. Typony is a typing assistant that suggests how to complete your phrases as you start typing. It analyzes your input and predicts the best possible phrase completions, allowing you to type faster and with fewer mistakes.

## How we built it
Tamed Mr. Typony was built as part of the Devpost Hackathon for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge. The goal was to develop a web application or Chrome Extension that uses Chrome's built-in AI APIs to leverage integrated models such as Gemini Nano.
